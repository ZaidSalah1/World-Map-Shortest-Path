# Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm
This project implements Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm to find the shortest path between the capitals of different countries. It takes a graph of capitals and distances between them and calculates the shortest path from a given starting capital to all other capitals.

## Features 
- Calculates the shortest path from a starting capital to all other capitals.
- Displays the shortest distance and the path taken.
- Supports various input formats for flexibility.

# Usage
- Ensure you have the input data file in the correct format (see Input Format).
- Run the application and provide the starting capital as input.
- The program will output the shortest path and distances to all other capitals.

# Input Format
The input should be a text file containing the distances between the capitals in the following format:
