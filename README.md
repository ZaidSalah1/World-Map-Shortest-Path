# Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm
This project implements Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm to find the shortest path between the capitals of different countries. It takes a graph of capitals and distances between them and calculates the shortest path from a given starting capital to all other capitals.

# Features 
- Calculates the shortest path from a starting capital to all other capitals.
- Displays the shortest distance and the path taken.
- Supports various input formats for flexibility.
